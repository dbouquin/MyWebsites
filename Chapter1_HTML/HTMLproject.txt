        <h3>A few jelly facts</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Most jellyfish do not have specialized digestive, osmoregulatory, central nervous, respiratory, or circulatory systems.</li>
            <li>Some jellyfish have ocelli: light-sensitive organs that do not form images but which can detect light and are used to determine up from down, responding to sunlight shining on the water's surface.</li>
            <li> Jellyfish range from about one millimeter in bell height and diameter to nearly two meters in bell height and diameter; the tentacles and mouth parts usually extend beyond this bell dimension. </li>
        </ul>
